{"tagline":"An easy API connector to Google Analytics in R","body":"# R Google Analytics\r\n\r\nThis is a package for extracting data from Google Analytics into R.\r\n\r\nThe package uses OAuth 2.0 ([protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22)) to access the Google Analytics API.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Manually\r\n\r\nInstall the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:\r\n\r\n\tinstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n\tlibrary(devtools)\r\n\r\nAnd then run the `install_github` command:\r\n\r\n\tinstall_github(\"rga\", \"skardhamar\")\r\n\tlibrary(rga)\r\n\r\n## Authenticating\r\n\r\nThe principle of this package is to create an instance of the API Authentication, which is a S4/5-class (utilizing the setRefClass). This instance then contains all the functions needed to extract data, and all the data needed for the authentication and reauthentication. The class is in essence self sustaining.\r\n\r\nThis means that you can create as many instances as you need.\r\n\r\n#### Basic use\r\n\r\nThe instance is created with the `rga.open` command:\r\n\r\n\trga.open(instance=\"ga\")\r\n\r\nThis will check if the instance is already created, and if it is, it'll prepare the token. If the instance is not created, it'll create the instance, and redirect the client to a browser for authentication with Google.\r\n\r\nYou then have to authenticate the application, Google will then output an access code, which you need to enter in the R console.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced use\r\n\r\nIf you want to store the instance locally, this can be done by adding the `where` attribute:\r\n\r\n\trga.open(instance=\"ga\", where=\"~/ga.rga\")\r\n\r\nThis means, that even if you delete the `.RData` workspace, the package will make sure you have access to the API.\r\n\r\n#### Use own Google API Client\r\n\r\nIf you want to use your own Google API Client, you need to provide this data in the `rga.open`:\r\n\r\n\trga.open(instance = \"ga\", \r\n\t\t\t client.id = \"862341168163-qtefv92ckvn2gveav66im725c3gqj728.apps.googleusercontent.com\", \r\n\t\t\t client.secret = \"orSEbf0-S76VZv6RMHe46z_N\")\r\n\r\nCreate a project in [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) to acquire `client.id` and `client.secret`.\r\n\r\n## Extracting data\r\n\r\nIn order to extract data from the instance, there is a couple of commands to use. The most important one is `$getData`:\r\n\r\n\tga$getData(ids, start.date, end.date, \r\n\t\t\t   metrics = \"ga:visits\", dimensions = \"ga:date\", \r\n\t\t\t   sort = \"\", filters = \"\", segment = \"\",\r\n\t\t\t   start = 1, max = 1000)\r\n\r\nThis will output the data in a data frame, with all the correct formats applied. The syntax follows the one dictated by Google - please refer to the documentation for further information.\r\n\r\nThe dates defaults to the current day, meaning that if you don't input these, only data from today will be extracted.","name":"R Google Analytics","note":"Don't delete this file!
